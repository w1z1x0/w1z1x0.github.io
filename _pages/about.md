<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking UniversityÔºàÂåó‰∫¨Â§ßÂ≠¶‰ø°ÊÅØÁßëÂ≠¶ÊäÄÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢Ôºâ.

My research interest includes **Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Reinforcement Learning**. I have project experience in prompt engineering, fine-tuning, SFT, inference, and dataset generation for LLMs. 

I'm currently doing a research internship in Professor [Wan XiaojunÔºà‰∏áÂ∞èÂÜõÔºâ](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/)'s lab at Peking University, working on a project involving automated idea generation, experimentation, paper writing, review for **AI Scientists**.

My major is computer science, and I have taken courses such as Introduction to Computer Systems, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Data Structures and Algorithms, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Statistical Analysis and Business Intelligence, Operating Systems, Databases, Reinforcement Learning, Probability and Statistics, Data Visualization, Intelligent robotics, and Fundamentals of Large Language Models.


# üìù Projects and Experience
